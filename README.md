This is modified from https://github.com/shyamupa/snli-entailment.   
* (1)tf_model.py can work on tensorflow 1.0, the errors arised by the tensorflow or python version update have been modified.  
  Some other small errors have been modified.  
* (2) The datasets have been provided   
* (3) implement by type:  python tf_model.py -train train.txt -dev dev.txt -test test.txt


Implementations of a attention model for entailment from [this paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06664) in keras and tensorflow.

* Download [snli dataset](http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/).
